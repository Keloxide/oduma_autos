                        <h2>History of Car Dealership:</h2>
                        <p>The early cars were sold by automakers to customers directly, or through a variety of channels that included mail order, department stores, and traveling representatives. The first dealership in the United States was established in 1898 by William E. Metzger . Direct sales by an automaker to consumers are now limited by most states in the U.S. through franchise laws that require new cars be sold only by licensed and bonded, independently owned dealerships....<a href="">Read more</a></p>

                        <h2>The Franchise:</h2>
                        <p>Car dealerships are typically franchised to sell and service vehicles by specific companies. They are often located on properties offering enough room to have buildings housing a showroom, mechanical service, and body repair facilities, as well as to provide storage for used and new vehicles. Many dealerships are located out of town or on the edge of town centers. An example of a traditional single proprietorship car dealership is Collier Motors in North Carolina. Many modern dealerships are part of corporate-owned chains such as AutoNation with over 300 franchises. Dealership profits mainly come from servicing, some from used cars, and little from new cars. The average new car price was $33,419 in 2015, while used cars cost $19,397....<a href="">Read more</a> </p>
